1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.754
Someone at home 
did this when he was younger.

2.
00:00:03.754 --> 00:00:05.754
when he was a teenager.

3
00:00:05.754 --> 00:00:09.343
It was either his mother or his uncle. 
at some point in time.

4
00:00:10.575 --> 00:00:16.787
He's very kind-hearted. but he doesn't
feel that he has to do anything.

5
00:00:16.787 --> 00:00:19.482
There's this kind of pampering.

6
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.608
I don't know why he gets 
this special treatment.

7
00:00:24.608 --> 00:00:27.778
That attitude of
"Let him sleep. he's tired..."

8
00:00:27.778 --> 00:00:31.520
What's so sacred about a man's sleep?

9
00:00:34.577 --> 00:00:36.287
That's the problem you need to solve.

10
00:00:36.287 --> 00:00:38.287
There's another party involved in it.

11
00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:41.125
You have to reach a solution together.

12
00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:44.378
One of the currently available solutions

13
00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:46.964
is to bring in a woman to help out.

14
00:00:46.964 --> 00:00:49.464
This woman will come 
and be treated well.

15
00:00:49.464 --> 00:00:51.927
She will live with us at home.

16
00:00:51.927 --> 00:00:58.559
Of course. there's always a preference
not to have anyone at home with us.

17
00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.812
But as long as Tarek
can't make time for me

18
00:01:01.812 --> 00:01:03.439
the way that I make time for everything.

19
00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:05.606
then we need a domestic worker.

20
00:01:05.606 --> 00:01:08.068
This is what ultimately convinced him.

21
00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:11.572
Are you able to set aside
half of your day?

22
00:01:11.572 --> 00:01:15.284
I dedicate half of my day to the house
and the other half to work.

23
00:01:15.284 --> 00:01:17.284
Are you able to dedicate 
half of your day? No.

24
00:01:17.284 --> 00:01:21.624
If he has a project. he can be out of the house for a whole week. night and day.

25
00:01:21.707 --> 00:01:23.375
Who is he leaving it all to? To me.

26
00:01:27.296 --> 00:01:31.542
Speaking in absolute terms
cleaning the house is my responsibility.

27
00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:34.887
Well. it's the responsibility 
of everyone living here...

28
00:01:34.887 --> 00:01:38.015
If I am using the plate. I have to clean it.

29
00:01:38.015 --> 00:01:39.642
If he is using a plate. he has to clean it.

30
00:01:39.642 --> 00:01:45.189
In that sense. 
I wish I didn't need to have a maid.

31
00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.525
but I can't.

32
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.363
Life would become too difficult.

33
00:01:52.363 --> 00:01:56.200
Especially if you consider

34
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.160
Masculinity... in the sense that

35
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.039
Is cleaning the house really my responsibility? No it's not.

36
00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:03.833
But it has been designated
as my responsibility.

37
00:02:03.833 --> 00:02:06.585
So I am expected to go to work 
but the house has to be spotless.

38
00:02:06.585 --> 00:02:10.881
Clean clothes should 
be hanging in the closet.

39
00:02:12.675 --> 00:02:16.394
If there are no clean clothes.
whose responsibility is it?

40
00:02:16.777 --> 00:02:20.474
It's never the responsibility of 
the person who dirtied the clothes.

41
00:02:20.474 --> 00:02:24.019
It's always up to the mother. 
the woman of the house.

42
00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:29.149
The domestic worker is 
an important solution

43
00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:31.026
where my children are concerned.

44
00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:34.280
Because I work long hours

45
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.115
and I need a solution.

46
00:02:36.115 --> 00:02:39.535
When I first got married.
I didn't need a maid.

47
00:02:39.535 --> 00:02:42.538
Even when the kids 
were young. I managed.

48
00:02:42.538 --> 00:02:44.039
But as they grew older

49
00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:48.419
I needed someone to stay at home
when I went out.

50
00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:53.507
Especially at night. 
because I often had night shifts

51
00:02:53.507 --> 00:02:57.344
or I had to accompany my husband 
to social events.

52
00:02:57.344 --> 00:03:00.431
He is a doctor and has many
conferences to attend.

53
00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:02.224
I always had to accompany him.

54
00:03:02.224 --> 00:03:05.019
There were no babysitters

55
00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.144
to call up at the last minute 
or to pay by the hour.

56
00:03:07.144 --> 00:03:10.065
So the maid was one of the solutions

57
00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:12.065
that my husband and I found

58
00:03:12.065 --> 00:03:14.194
to maintain our social life.

59
00:03:18.324 --> 00:03:22.077
All this time that I had to myself
before getting married

60
00:03:22.077 --> 00:03:25.497
evaporated with the presence of kids

61
00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:27.497
the husband. the social life

62
00:03:27.497 --> 00:03:29.776
and other responsibilities...

63
00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:33.631
One becomes like a motor. always running

64
00:03:33.631 --> 00:03:35.507
with no time to herself.

65
00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:40.471
The domestic worker's presence
gave me back that lost time.

66
00:03:40.471 --> 00:03:44.141
and I felt

67
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:47.827
I could go back to that earlier time

68
00:03:47.827 --> 00:03:51.857
and resume my work

69
00:03:51.857 --> 00:03:53.857
and progress in it.

70
00:03:53.857 --> 00:03:56.320
If I stay late at work.
it's not a big issue.

71
00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.658
That was the nicest thing about it.

72
00:04:00.658 --> 00:04:04.620
I went back to work with full force

73
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.248
I could really give it my time 
and energy.  and develop

74
00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:12.086
and become as productive
as my husband.

75
00:04:12.086 --> 00:04:14.380
He and I became equal.

76
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.218
But development at work

77
00:04:19.218 --> 00:04:22.888
also creates a side to my life

78
00:04:22.888 --> 00:04:25.849
that they don't know much about.

79
00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:29.436
Clients. phone calls. 
and sometimes invitations...

80
00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:32.189
Something happens.

81
00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:34.733
It's not that he feels threatened

82
00:04:34.733 --> 00:04:37.361
but something eats at him.

83
00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:40.698
We are on a more equal footing

84
00:04:40.698 --> 00:04:46.036
at the level of productivity
but also of independence.

85
00:04:46.036 --> 00:04:50.708
This is when he starts to poke a little

86
00:04:50.708 --> 00:04:53.585
"I want this dish done by your hand..."

87
00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:59.425
As if to insinuate.
or at least so I felt.

88
00:04:59.425 --> 00:05:02.469
that I am falling short 
of my duties at home.

89
00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:04.469
he wants this dish or that thing done...

90
00:05:05.097 --> 00:05:10.602
Keeping in mind that someone needs to supervise the maid at home.

91
00:05:10.602 --> 00:05:13.105
and it's always the job
of the lady of the house.

92
00:05:13.105 --> 00:05:14.940
She buys the detergents

93
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.233
she tells the her what to do.

94
00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:18.193
On Monday. Wednesday and Friday
clean the living room.

95
00:05:18.193 --> 00:05:22.114
On Tuesday. Thursday. etc...
clean the balconies.

96
00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:27.244
So managing the maid's work
is the job of the lady of the house.

97
00:05:27.244 --> 00:05:29.204
This responsibility always falls on her

98
00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:30.748
and the man has nothing to do with it.

99
00:05:30.748 --> 00:05:34.571
So she gives us the time to go work outside the house

100
00:05:34.571 --> 00:05:38.816
and the husband has to accept this idea.

101
00:05:38.816 --> 00:05:40.800
That's just how things are.

102
00:05:45.637 --> 00:05:49.016
What I am discovering. 
and which is rarely mentioned.

103
00:05:49.016 --> 00:05:51.018
I don't know if you agree...

104
00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:59.838
is that I need my time to be a woman.

105
00:06:04.782 --> 00:06:06.992
By this I mean...

106
00:06:06.992 --> 00:06:10.370
Not to be limited to daily chores.

107
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.208
If both he and I are occupied by them

108
00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:15.375
Did we sweep the balcony?

109
00:06:15.375 --> 00:06:18.212
Did we wash the reusable diapers?

110
00:06:18.212 --> 00:06:22.633
If we both spend our time 
only on this kind of conversation...

111
00:06:24.164 --> 00:06:26.000
If we are only living
this kind of experience...

112
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.055
At work.  and then we start 
something else

113
00:06:28.055 --> 00:06:30.055
because this kind of work never ends...

114
00:06:30.933 --> 00:06:34.686
In fact. the nightmare is 
that housework never ends.

115
00:06:34.686 --> 00:06:37.511
You can't just do it twice a week.

116
00:06:37.511 --> 00:06:39.233
especially if you have kids.

117
00:06:39.944 --> 00:06:42.027
So your life becomes only about that.

118
00:06:44.154 --> 00:06:47.825
So the real crime is that

119
00:06:47.825 --> 00:06:50.410
we are hiring a woman and limiting
her life to just that one thing.

120
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.288
But when we take care 
of the kids on the weekend.

121
00:06:53.288 --> 00:06:55.100
she has time to be a woman.

122
00:06:55.777 --> 00:06:59.378
Give me the rest of the week.

123
00:06:59.378 --> 00:07:02.965
so that I am able to take a shower
when I get back from work

124
00:07:02.965 --> 00:07:06.635
instead of cleaning the house
as soon as I'm home.

125
00:07:06.635 --> 00:07:08.523
You know what I mean?

126
00:07:08.523 --> 00:07:10.973
I can take a shower
maybe go out to dinner

127
00:07:10.973 --> 00:07:12.973
or feel beautiful again

128
00:07:12.973 --> 00:07:16.270
or we can kiss on the balcony...

129
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:21.775
That way we're not just people who...

130
00:07:21.775 --> 00:07:24.236
have completely lost our libido

131
00:07:24.236 --> 00:07:28.574
who have lost this feeling

132
00:07:28.574 --> 00:07:30.075
that I am a woman
you are a man...

133
00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:32.075
How did we use to 
encounter each other before?

134
00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:40.544
If there's no worker to take care
of them. we're in trouble.

135
00:07:40.544 --> 00:07:42.963
That means I have to quit my job

136
00:07:44.673 --> 00:07:47.217
I don't want to put them 
in a nursing home

137
00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:49.386
because my parents are not ill.

138
00:07:49.386 --> 00:07:50.804
Although my mother keeps telling me

139
00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:52.598
we can take care of ourselves. 
stop worrying.

140
00:07:52.598 --> 00:07:55.100
Your father can still drive

141
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.100
don't worry.

142
00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.228
But I don't know...

143
00:07:58.228 --> 00:08:02.357
Maybe I am obsessing 
about my parents

144
00:08:02.357 --> 00:08:04.735
but I got really scared 
when my mother fell.

145
00:08:04.735 --> 00:08:07.195
I just don't want to think about

146
00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:08.614
who will look after my parents

147
00:08:08.614 --> 00:08:11.158
if the maid leaves or there is no maid

148
00:08:11.158 --> 00:08:15.287
because that will only 
make matters worse.

149
00:08:15.287 --> 00:08:18.457
Right now. I don't want to think ahead.

150
00:08:18.457 --> 00:08:21.543
I have a maid. so let me be at ease

151
00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:25.876
and not worry about difficult decisions 
I have to make in the future.

152
00:08:29.217 --> 00:08:32.022
With the best treatment.

153
00:08:32.706 --> 00:08:35.849
under the best conditions

154
00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:38.852
and I give her all the vacation
time she wants.

155
00:08:38.852 --> 00:08:40.103
because I respect the fact

156
00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:42.439
that in front of me is a human being

157
00:08:42.439 --> 00:08:45.417
who already must not enjoy living
in my house instead of her own...

158
00:08:45.417 --> 00:08:46.947
I am aware of all of this.

159
00:08:46.947 --> 00:08:50.492
But I couldn't do anything else
under these conditions.

160
00:08:50.492 --> 00:08:53.492
So you can't ask me why I had kids
or why I am working

161
00:08:53.492 --> 00:08:58.497
if on a humane level.
I am opposed to the principle.

162
00:08:58.497 --> 00:09:00.497
I am not opposed to that degree.

163
00:09:00.497 --> 00:09:02.709
It turns out I am not that opposed to it.

164
00:09:02.709 --> 00:09:05.128
There's this whole other point of view

165
00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:08.173
that the woman also needs money.

166
00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:10.008
she is also learning things.

167
00:09:10.008 --> 00:09:11.051
she too will have children

168
00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:13.095
and will rely on the experience
she gathered.

169
00:09:13.095 --> 00:09:16.034
Whatever. She likes us and we like her.

170
00:09:16.034 --> 00:09:18.266
All these things...

171
00:09:19.518 --> 00:09:22.813
I've never had a difficult experience
with a maid at home.

172
00:09:22.813 --> 00:09:27.192
Karim is very likeable

173
00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:28.767
and so am I.

174
00:09:28.767 --> 00:09:32.864
On a humane level
the experience was not so bad

175
00:09:32.864 --> 00:09:35.659
that I thought I had to quit work

176
00:09:35.659 --> 00:09:39.204
and bury myself at home with my kids.
cooking and cleaning.

177
00:09:39.204 --> 00:09:43.324
And quit my work that I love
and that means a lot to me.

178
00:09:47.315 --> 00:09:51.201
I still think that the system is repugnant.

179
00:09:51.201 --> 00:09:54.513
but it's a question of survival for me.

180
00:09:55.114 --> 00:09:57.907
I was losing it. I got depressed.

181
00:09:57.907 --> 00:10:01.082
I found myself cooking 
and cleaning all day.

182
00:10:01.082 --> 00:10:02.578
That's not my ambition in life.

183
00:10:03.234 --> 00:10:06.666
To go on with my life and be 
something else than a mother

184
00:10:06.666 --> 00:10:08.147
I needed someone to help me.

185
00:10:08.147 --> 00:10:11.541
And my husband was unable
to provide more than 10%.

186
00:10:11.541 --> 00:10:13.791
that's the most he could do.

187
00:10:14.392 --> 00:10:16.857
I've not made peace 
with the Kafala system

188
00:10:16.857 --> 00:10:19.216
I am still opposed to it

189
00:10:19.216 --> 00:10:21.353
but I found no other solution.

190
00:10:24.743 --> 00:10:27.904
I am assigning her particular duties

191
00:10:27.904 --> 00:10:30.669
but I am still present.
raising the children and taking care.

192
00:10:30.669 --> 00:10:35.211
Even with a domestic worker at home.
many things remain to be done.

193
00:10:35.211 --> 00:10:36.528
There are decisions to be made.

194
00:10:36.528 --> 00:10:38.199
I tell her what to do.

195
00:10:38.199 --> 00:10:40.394
I am giving her tasks

196
00:10:40.394 --> 00:10:44.668
which drain my energy.

197
00:10:44.668 --> 00:10:46.941
when I could use my energy elsewhere.

198
00:10:46.941 --> 00:10:49.054
But this doesn't mean 
I gave her all my duties

199
00:10:49.054 --> 00:10:51.327
or that she's become 
the mother. Not at all.

200
00:10:54.307 --> 00:10:58.803
Personally. I used to make time

201
00:10:58.803 --> 00:11:04.876
to learn about their circumstances.
their problems and their lives.

202
00:11:04.876 --> 00:11:07.532
I even followed their news back home.

203
00:11:07.969 --> 00:11:11.867
When it was time for them to leave

204
00:11:11.867 --> 00:11:16.273
we would prepare their departure

205
00:11:16.273 --> 00:11:20.624
what needs to be done. 
how to collect money for them...

206
00:11:24.232 --> 00:11:29.676
For example. Masay
who stayed with us for 9 years

207
00:11:29.676 --> 00:11:34.273
sent all her money to her parents
during the first 4 years.

208
00:11:34.956 --> 00:11:39.610
After 4 years I told her that's enough.
I will save the money for you.

209
00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:43.825
Whatever you need in expenses

210
00:11:43.825 --> 00:11:46.102
I'll give you a certain amount every day

211
00:11:46.102 --> 00:11:49.469
but let's save up the rest.

212
00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:53.218
She's working but 
without money to show for it.

213
00:11:53.218 --> 00:11:57.069
We thought about what she could
do when she went back to her country.

214
00:11:57.069 --> 00:12:01.174
She could use the money 
to open a restaurant.

215
00:12:01.174 --> 00:12:03.885
and she now cooks 
better Lebanese food than I do!

216
00:12:03.885 --> 00:12:06.650
She could open a Lebanese restaurant...

217
00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:10.071
So we brainstormed together.

218
00:12:11.465 --> 00:12:14.831
It made me feel

219
00:12:14.831 --> 00:12:16.367
that I am securing their future.

220
00:12:16.367 --> 00:12:22.604
Guaranteeing that the years
they spent here amounted to something.

221
00:12:22.604 --> 00:12:26.625
It was not wasted time in their life.

222
00:12:26.625 --> 00:12:29.718
I felt I was securing their future

223
00:12:29.718 --> 00:12:32.593
as a sort of compensation

224
00:12:32.593 --> 00:12:36.548
with which they can 
start something new elsewhere.

225
00:12:40.826 --> 00:12:43.099
In fact. I didn't see them.

226
00:12:43.099 --> 00:12:50.675
I was so caught up with my husband.
my kids. my social life...

227
00:12:50.675 --> 00:12:53.444
I just didn't see them. 
They were invisible to me.

228
00:12:55.299 --> 00:13:01.227
It was only after I became aware
of my own desire for freedom

229
00:13:01.227 --> 00:13:03.227
after my divorce.

230
00:13:04.375 --> 00:13:09.064
that I noticed her as a person 
who is living with me at home.

231
00:13:09.064 --> 00:13:12.403
I realized that she was a human being.

232
00:13:17.789 --> 00:13:22.249
Invisible previously? Yes they were.

233
00:13:22.249 --> 00:13:28.649
They were always an extension 
of me. never a priority.

234
00:13:28.649 --> 00:13:32.781
But when the kids grew up. and particularly after the divorce.

235
00:13:32.781 --> 00:13:36.804
when I was no longer 
ordering her around non-stop

236
00:13:36.804 --> 00:13:39.159
that's when I noticed her presence.

237
00:13:39.159 --> 00:13:41.817
I started seeing her. 
She became visible to me.

238
00:13:45.316 --> 00:13:49.819
Suddenly I felt that I had a mission.

239
00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:55.126
My dear girl. exist! Be visible!

240
00:13:55.126 --> 00:13:57.463
You have the right to exist. 
 You can.

241
00:13:57.463 --> 00:14:00.000
Exist beyond the work I give you.

242
00:14:03.198 --> 00:14:07.330
Well. I am trying. But apparently
she doesn't want to take that step.

243
00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.492
A woman stays with you for 9 years

244
00:14:12.492 --> 00:14:15.285
and then she leaves... just like that.

245
00:14:15.285 --> 00:14:18.296
When she's gone. nobody 
brings her up anymore.

246
00:14:18.296 --> 00:14:19.561
She disappears.

247
00:14:21.775 --> 00:14:25.381
I was worried about 
what would happen when she left.

248
00:14:25.381 --> 00:14:30.825
Not at the level of services
I would get another domestic worker.

249
00:14:30.825 --> 00:14:33.262
But I worried about missing her.

250
00:14:33.262 --> 00:14:36.000
especially the kids.
What would we do?

251
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.050
Nadi was 4 years old. and Nour 6.

252
00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:43.232
She raised them. 
she held the house together.

253
00:14:43.232 --> 00:14:45.030
But when she left...

254
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:46.757
That was it. she was gone.

255
00:14:47.331 --> 00:14:51.516
Even the kids grew up and understood.

256
00:14:52.363 --> 00:14:54.637
How do I explain it?

257
00:14:54.637 --> 00:14:56.418
For example.

258
00:14:56.418 --> 00:14:59.788
It's like she is a picture frame.

259
00:14:59.788 --> 00:15:02.034
She frames the family picture.

260
00:15:02.034 --> 00:15:04.119
You can remove the frame. 
the picture stays.

261
00:15:04.119 --> 00:15:07.626
You change the frame 
but the picture remains the same.

262
00:15:07.626 --> 00:15:09.353
Nobody can come into the picture.

263
00:15:12.414 --> 00:15:14.742
Without a doubt.

264
00:15:14.742 --> 00:15:18.546
the underlying reason for her presence

265
00:15:18.546 --> 00:15:21.776
is due to a fundamental failure

266
00:15:21.776 --> 00:15:23.229
on our part

267
00:15:23.229 --> 00:15:25.229
regarding the home.

268
00:15:25.229 --> 00:15:28.323
despite the discourse that argues

269
00:15:28.323 --> 00:15:33.439
that we're working all the time. 
and income. and house chores...

270
00:15:35.189 --> 00:15:39.107
If you want. it's a compromise
that one tries to make.

271
00:15:40.801 --> 00:15:48.186
On one hand. it stops the wife
from saying she is overworked.

272
00:15:48.186 --> 00:15:51.611
On the other hand. 
the man puts his mind at ease.

273
00:15:51.611 --> 00:15:55.330
and  spends some money 
to get rid of the headache.

274
00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.052
That's how it is in the end.

275
00:15:57.353 --> 00:16:02.688
But the ethical dimension 
keeps playing in my head.

276
00:16:03.426 --> 00:16:08.925
It never goes away. but I forget it 
or ignore it sometimes.

277
00:16:10.925 --> 00:16:14.675
When it's in my interest
of course. I do that.

278
00:16:14.675 --> 00:16:17.822
You choose what gives you comfort.

279
00:16:17.822 --> 00:16:20.989
You buy problems off.
